Hi, 
My aasuption was creating simple app with possibilities to develop in in future to new components. 
My app is storing data in localstorage, but logic for data flow is made outside components so can be easy change 
to retrieve data from some data base in future. 
I prepared dynamic content for homepage so can be in future goes from backend and for 
this moment is simple to changing it, without changing markup.  
I have created React.js project. I have decided to use this technologies 
because currently I'm very insteresting of this framework. I'm started learning react two months ago and 
this project was very good oportunitty for me to check my knowledge about it in practice. 
Earlier in my projects I have used vanilla js, web components and Vue.js. Thats why as alternative 
I can propose create this app based on web components for example lit-html or Vue.js. 
In readme you can find information how to start project. 
I'm waiting for your feedback. 

Thanks, 
Joanna Wrzesi≈Ñska
